start discussions with something easy to answer to make sure people start talking

cons:
- less equal opportunity
- certain areas more developed
- decreased efficiency in certain endeavors

just saying there should be a balance is too vague. Where should the line be?

when you speak, have an intro, body and conclusion in mind before you start speaking

people like quick fixes

if you are going on a tangent, say so before you start speaking so people do not misinterpret

people do not value themselves as much as others

false positives and false negatives can have a significant impact depending on the field and the situation

analyze the numbers and whether a false positive or negative would be more dangerous, and make the less dangerous outcome more likely in the product (covid test false negative is worse)

scientists are indoctrinated into all these standards of proof that can influence their mindset in other areas of life

specific terms are better for scientific explanation, and if anyone doesn't understand they can ask for the laymonds terms

framing determines how stats will be interpreted

when is manipulation OK? Where is the line between informing and manipulating?

geoengineering vs solar radiation management vs climate intervention

the non expert journalists play an important role in the flow of information and can be manipulative

what if scientists do not engage with journalists at all?

what has been the case instead of what should be

if things do not evolve they wont grow

things are not always 100% right or explainable but the information is the best that can be used to solve a real world problem

- paradigm shift

review Kuhnian thesis

scientific development is characterized by the creation of paradigms, which are sets of theories (umbrellas) established and through further clarification by experiment and theory, (normal) science occurs

normal science: scientists conducting experiments to expand understanding within a paradigm

theoretical physics: newton established classical mechanics

people accepted newtons laws, but knew there was room for improvement

results are generally explainable but weirdisms occur

scientific crisis is where enough anomolies occur that people realize that something needs to change

incommensurable: two paradigms are not comparable because they are too different and use different logic

Chapter 1: explaining the thesis

old people get stuck in their ways and don't want to adapt; they die and then the younger people will adapt

powerful writing is clear, consise and to the point with powerful arguments

the SCC application and research papers is a good writing style

for an anomaly to occur, there must already be a paradigm set up with rules that get violated

pedagogy:

labs indoctrinate students into how to perform experiments

paradigms from different times cannot effectively communicate

gestalt: duck and bunny in the same image

gestalt can be applied to science and paradigm shift

paradigm selection involves deciding which problems need to be solved

paradigm selection not always logical

cannot be in two paradigms at once

Aristotle explained things through "essences". Now that we are post newtonian, all that sounds ridiculous because we know more, but it was a perfectly reasonable explanation back in the day.

einstein did not like the probabilistic nature of quantum

scientists tend to be skeptical because they deal with partial truths and unknowns

traditional science: building up facts in a pyramid until reach the top

kuhn: squiggly line that gets less squiggly as progress occurs

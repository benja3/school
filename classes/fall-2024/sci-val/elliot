start discussions with something easy to answer to make sure people start talking

cons:
- less equal opportunity
- certain areas more developed
- decreased efficiency in certain endeavors

just saying there should be a balance is too vague. Where should the line be?

when you speak, have an intro, body and conclusion in mind before you start speaking

people like quick fixes

if you are going on a tangent, say so before you start speaking so people do not misinterpret

people do not value themselves as much as others

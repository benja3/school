# First Day

## Syllabus

I am in section 004

need to buy the books

Don't worry about it yet

no exams or tests

Reading notes due at 10 Am the previous day; only have to do it 1 day of the week

Allowed two weeks of skipping reading notes, but get extra credit for doing all

Each student must ask two thoughtful discussion leading questions of the day's text
- playing teacher
- questions should be deep beyond the literal meaning of the text

Due dates are the drop dead last minute to do something. A better way to do things is to do things early and put in the necessary time to do it well in a relaxed manner instead of racing to get it done at the last second.

Teachers grade more nicely when they are not tired.

Reconfigure how you think about due dates

look at helpful resources

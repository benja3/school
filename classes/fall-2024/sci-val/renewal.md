# The Great Renewal: Francis Bacon

### What is Science?

Science is the study of natural phenomena by applying the scientific method to execute experiments that provide falsifiable data.


### Notes

deductive: develop a general principle about a thing; start at general and narrow down to specific

inductive: start at the specifics and develop a general
- the sun will rise in the east tomorrow (and every day in the future) because it has risen in the east every day since
- This is the new science according to Bacon

Due to time, Bacon molds his arguments around Christianity in a complementary way

Argues that people have spent too much time on religion, politics, philosophy, etc. and not enough on science and the study of nature

The inductive method solves the errors problem with replication

Bacon calls out science for not having specific and solid facts and being disputable by different perspectives

Bacon is the founder of the scientific revolution

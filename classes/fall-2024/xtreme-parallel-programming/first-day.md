# First Day

think of topics to deep dive on

HPC: chefs in the kitchen

easy to write code, hard to write efficient code

applications the driving force behind HPC; systems designed to work well on applications

HPC Systems:
- computation emphasized
- uses all the data
- tight coupling between tasks

Datacenters:
- storage emphasis
- computation rarely needs to use all the data
- few dependencies on tasks

the most important question on HPC is how to map the problem to the system

mismanaged communication can destroy performance

application must be good single threaded before multithreading

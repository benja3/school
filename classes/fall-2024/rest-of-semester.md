# Plan for the Rest of the Semester

## Projects and Deadlines

### Senior Design: December 3rd, Tuesday After Thanksgiving

Huge program that will require lots of testing and integration before its done. The amount of actual days I have to work on it is very small. Today, Saturday and Sunday when I get back, and the Monday after Thanksgiving. Unless I am willing to work on it at the conference, which I really do not want to do.


### Random Signals Final: Monday of Finals week

Typical finals grind protocol. Break it up, schedule and start grinding it out.

Contents:
- Chapter 1: Sections 2,3,4
- Chapter 2: Sections 1,2,3,4,5
- Chapter 3: Sections 1,2,3,4,5
- Chapter 4: Sections 1,2,3,4,5,6,7

### Controls Final: Tuesday of Finals week

Typical finals grind protocol.

Review slides 2 - 22
Learn homework and old exam problems.

Keep in mind not everything is important. Make sure you understand the concepts at a high level and then work on grinding practice problems.

Rewrite the notesheets.

### Parallel Computing Project

Submit Proposal ASAP. Need to relate it to ICON, so it would be good to have the plan before SCC so I can double dip.

### Bodde Final Project

Writing essay on how Kuhn's philosophies would be changed in a world where new science is simulated instead of tested in natural experiments.

7-10 Pages, typical layout

Figure out how to structure a philosphy paper

Do not spend too much time on this. I can realistically wait until the day of and bang it out with ChatGPT.

# Day 1

applications have sets of needs that must be considered

the best design is the one that meets the customers needs

often must compromise because not everything can be satisfied

this lab involves integrating everything we learned to create stuff that is useful in the real world

must get previous projects working for future ones or there will be an integration disaster at the end

think early, build later

think first, measure twice

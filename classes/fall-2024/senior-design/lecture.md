Problems often have multiple solution. The engineer picks the best solution based on the situation.

Identify possible solutions and choose the best

Brainstorming is coming up with individuals in the space of all possible solutions randomly. There is no method and everyone is just trying to come up with whatever their imagination can. It is not systematic.

TRIZ is more systematic: find a starting point idea and develop based on that. Sometimes an idea is not a good starting point and must find a new one.

No criticism during brainstorming, a modification of a crazy idea can be great.

It is easy to go off topic when brainstorming due to the sheer volume of ideas.

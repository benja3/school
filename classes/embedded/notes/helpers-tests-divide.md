display data does not care about header

it is worth the extra time spent on this 

## Helpers

Important to organize your programming environment the same way you organize a kitchen for cooking

should be thinking about organizational work at all times 

will likely spend more time organizing than doing the actually work 

Helpers: little small programs that help along the path of developing the full project 
- should do one thing well

use these to only work with one part of the system at a time and isolate problems 

Can run mini experiments to figure out how things work when documentation fails 

## Test Cases

How to test single helper isolated from everything else 

Create test images for the lab 

Testing on embedded system is harder than regular sofware; testing gets harder the lower level the code is 

do not spend a ton of time making helper programs beautiful, they should be throwaway programs 



## Divide and Conquer 

break things down and write programs and solutions just for that

once all the helpers are working, integrate them into the larger system

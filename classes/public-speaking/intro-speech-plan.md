## Script 

Hello Everyone! My name is Benjamin Schlueter and I am a junior computer engineering major from Mount Pleasant SC, outside of Charleston.

My first item here is a screwdriver that I use for tinkering with computers. I have always been fascinated by computers and wondered how they work, which lead me to taking them apart and playing around with both hardware and software. Until recently I could not afford to build my own PC, but now that I have made some money from an internship I splurged and designed and built my own fancy computer over Christmas break, where this screwdriver was used extensible. \

My second item is a running shoe. Since I have been in college, I have become a big runner. Being a computer engineering major requires lots and lots of hours sitting at a computer, and I need an energy boost from physical activity to stay productive. Right now I am doign marathon training, and hope to one day become an ultra runner. My end goal for running is to do a 100 mile ultramarathon. It seems like an incredible accomplishment.

My final item is this Los Alamos t-shirt. My niche in computer engineering is in supercomputing, and Los Alamos has some of the most advanced supercomputers in the world. I was fortunate enough to land an internship there last summer and it was a life changing experience. The combination of the work, the culture, and the location of Los Alamos is truly a dream career for me, and I am hoping that in the future I will be working there full time.

My bag is a backpack that I got at SC23, which is an international supercomputing conference. I went there to present research and compete in a high performance computing competition. This goes down as one of the best experiences I have had due to the sense of accomplishment from leading my team to do well in the competition and presenting my research on that huge stage. 

That is the end.

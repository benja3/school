# Delivery

The way you speak can influence credibility, audience connection, 

Enthusiastic delivery can make the most boring topic interesting

Always remind yourself that you are talking to people and they are considering your emotion and tone as you speak

## Do

### Volume

Speak to the back row

### conversational style

speak to the audience like it is a conversation

speak to them not at them

### Movement

Hand gestures

catch and maintain the attention of the audience 

do not overthink it

every so often when it feels comfortable, move to different locations on the floor

the motion should feel natural and not forced

### eye contact

rule of thirds:
- split audience into 3 groups
- look at the general groups and cycle through them as you present
- can also help with movement

do not stare at a specific person

### maintain steady speech rate

when you get nervous it is easy to speed up or slow down

add stops to take a deep breath 

## Don't

### monotone

avoid being flat and boring

### assume

do not assume your audience is or thinks a certain way

### adaptors

nervous habits like fidgetting 

hard to know you are doing it

### verbal fillers

a few are natural, but when they become repetetive it is noticeable and annoying

like a void that cannot be removed but only replaced 

replace the filler with silence 

fillers come when the brain is trying to catch up with the mouth

can be reduced by practicing the speech

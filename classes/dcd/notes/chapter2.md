# Digital Design Practices 

## Design Process 

### Specification 

Like PC specs: requirements, details and facts regarding the capabilities of the machine

Example specs: instruction set, I/O interface, etc. 

Must consider industry standards 

Must eventually stop refining and freeze specifications to not waste time 

Specification planning process results in a formal document with the specs clearly listed 

### Concept Development 

High level design of the system 

Evaluate different implemenation approaches 

Design subsystems and create specifications for these 

Select technologies that will be used and vendors that will provide them 

make vs buy decisions 

### Management of technical risks

if the product is too safe, it will not sell

if the product is too ambitions, it will not be feasible to develop on time 

generally good to take a few calculated risks but not go too hard

risk management in design is part of the art of engineering 

Consider the potential gains of the risk succeeding, vs cons of it goign wrong; 

Understand risks by gathering data and performing analysis 

### Partitioning 

Involves partitioning the high level system into modules and submodules, and designing each of those until the lowest level is reached 

This is called block level design 

### Verification

# VHDL 

This document will contain all of my knowledge on VHDL programming, good practices, and the general hardware design process


## Design Process

Store each component in a separate file  

### Testbenches

Create a test bench for each architecture  that you create 

Use series of wait statements and inputs to ensure the output is expected 

## Code

Use ' for std_logic and " for std_logic_vector

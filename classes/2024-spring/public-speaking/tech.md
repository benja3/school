Hello, Benjamin Schlueter 

Will be showing y'all a technique for debugging the issue of getting locked out of eduroam, because it seems like our the network turns on us all too frequently. I have personally been locked out of eduroam several times during my years at Clemson, and this has fixed it each time so I want to share it with y'all.

I will be resetting the network configuration of eduroam on my Mac. A similar approach can be done on any device by forgetting the network from settings. Mac is a very common device used on campus, and it is harder to do this on Mac than other platforms. 

First, Open settings or system preferences

Then, go to Network. WiFi should be auto selected by default, but if not, select in on the left so you see this menu.

Click the advanced button on the bottom right, and you should see all the networks your device has connected to in the past. 

Select eduroam and click the - sign to remove all connection information. 

Not on campus so I cannot show y'all how the rest, but would just reconnect the way you did the first time by entering your username and password.

What you would do is go to select a new network and select eduroam as ususal. This time you will be prompted for your username and password, and after entering those, you connection should be restored. 

This will fix some but not all of potential eduroam issues. Sometimes, you cannot connect to a WiFi access point because an area is too crowded, or eduroam itself might be having issues. I would recommend contacting CCIT if refreshing the network profile on your computer does not fix the issue you are experiencing. 

I hope this helps you the next time eduroam locks you out.

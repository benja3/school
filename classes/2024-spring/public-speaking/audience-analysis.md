if it is obvious the speaker does not care about you, how does that make you feel?

### Empathy

relate with your audience and understand how they feel

connect with them as human beings

### Flexibility

Be able to pivot and change your techniques if people are not responding well

Must be able to read the audience and monitor their responses 

## Audience Types

### Favorable

People who actually care and want to be there 

will probably have already heard similar content 

### Unfavorable

People who do not want to be there

Anything where the audience is forced to be there

must use more finesse to keep the audience engaged

An audience that disagrees with you

### Neutral

People with all ranges of enthusiasm

# Speaking Anxiety

If something obvious goes wrong before your speech, the audience will generally be supportive of you 

Anxiety typically rises during preparation due to anticipation, peaks as you are starting your speech, and drops off as your speech progresses

## State Anxiety

Specific aspect of what you are doing causes anxiety 

## Trait Anxiety

Anxiety coming from knowing you have anxiety 

## Reduction 

Positive visualization: imagine yourself doing good 

Make friends in the audience 

consider the worst that could happen and realize that it is not that bad 
- worst case survival guides 

add fallbacks in case things go wrong 
- do not rely on powerpoint speaker notes, create notecards as backup

Make sure you maintain your routine so that you feel good 

If something happens that causes anxiety during your speech, recollect yourself before trying to solve the problem 

Consider that everyone else also has the same type of anxiety, although it might not be visible 

NEVER mention you are nervous to the audience 

Practice to build confidence 

Do not expect things to be perfect

# Prolog

## Why Prolog

Prolog resources on slides

## Incremental Development Cycle

start by creating prolog database in a file or set of files

interpretation of source files

Prolog uses lots of recursion

Prolog inovles writing "clauses" which contain facts and rules

fact: simply delcarative statement

rules: contain variables to generalize how things fit together

prolog solves the problem in a brute force sort of way

## specifics

to read in file: ```consult('filename.pro')```

can specify arguments as inputs, outputs or both

Upper case letters indicate variables

Prolog does not do integer division by default becaue it treats everything like a float


## Protocol

turns on a logging system

## Lists

prolog lists similar to ocaml

lists built in, do not have to implement linked list

notation based on head and tail

head is head node and tail is the rest of the list after the tail

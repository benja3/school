# Semantics

Involves the meaning of the code and what it should actually do

People come up with specifications for what code needs to do

Need to be able to justify that code works with more than just a few test cases

There is no way to describe semantics like there is with syntax (grammar)

formal semantics relate language syntax to meaning which is usually a quantitative description of underlying computation

qualitative semantics: english paragraph that describes what code does
- not precise and ambiguous
- need something mathematical for accuracy

mathematical for describing semantics has not been found

attribbuted parse tree: nodes in the parse tree have attributes that describe what the code does

Meaning can rage from abstract descriptions to machine code generated on compile

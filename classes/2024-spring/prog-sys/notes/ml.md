# ML

Typed functional language

many names and variants for ML

Strongly typed languages do not let you do things like casts and conversions like you can do in C

Polymorphic: can pass different types to the same code and it will handle them differently depending on the type

supports user defined types like objects

has an interactive development mode like the python or prolog shell

ML implemented in ML

as efficient as C after compilation, which is rare because most OO langauges are slow

### Function Signature

every time a function is defined, must define return type and args

ML takes this informatino and creates a signature to represent the function (like C prototype)

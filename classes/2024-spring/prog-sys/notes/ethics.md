# Ethics

## Societal

Computer scientists and engineers do not have to be certified

Who is responsible if software hurts someone?

Anyone can write software and that can be ported to other projects

Radiation machine had a software issue and burned people

Software losing peoples money can cause lots of legal issues

People are tempted to use computers to hurt others

Must do software quality assurance, and understand your code well enough to test it thoroughly

How to tell that software is well tested?

software quality example: linux kernel

computers get thrown away and are made with rare materials, so the process of finding materials can cause environmental harm

## Impact of Computers

increased electrical and power usage

planned obsolescence: companies designing products such that they need to be replaced every few years


landfill isues mostly in 3rd world countries

smart homes can reduce power usage

computers lead to less paper usage

Ethics are applications of moral principles

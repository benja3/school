# Final Exam Review

## Plan

I have the rest of Tuesday, all of Wednesday and until 4 on Thursday to study for this exam. Lets unabstract and taskify. 

For an A: 96

For a B: 68

### Unabstract

Three of the questions will be from after exam 2, so the last two homeworks.
- fair queuing
- TCP state diagram
- fast transmit fast recovery ???

From past 2 exams:
- CIDR (probably with ARP)
- pipe full, throughput, etc.
- routing

Do not bother with HW questions except for 9 and 10, just review the old exams

For short answer, just go over the ones from all the old exams; do not need to go over every slide deck in detail

### Taskify

review exam 1

review exam 2

go back over hw 9 and 10

learn fast transmit fast recovery

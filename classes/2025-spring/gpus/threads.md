# Threads

Draw out grid, blocks and threads for each problem 

### Indexing Arrays with Blocks and Threads

Write checks to ensure that the block and thread counts do not go above hardware limits 

Eventually, will reach max threads per block, so expanding to use multiple blocks makes the program more scalable 

hardware information give by CUDA already in form of blockDim, blockIdx, etc.

# Day 3

breathing emergencies become circulation emergencies

responsive:
- eyes open
- look awake
- eye contact
- able to communicate
- may or may not be breathing

Unresponsive:
- not awake
- no eye movement or eye contact
- not able to communicate
- may or not be breathing

responsiveness does not depend on breathing

the average person is terrible at taking pulses; false positives are worse than false negatives

### choking

S/S: Signs and Symptoms
- coughing, abnormal breathing
- grasping their throat
- red, blue or purple face
- facial expression

responsive choking person:
- if coughing, airway only partially blocked
- if not coughing, airway blocked completely, call 911, back blows / abdominal thrusts
- stay near them until the blockage is cleared completely

back blows in between shoulder blades

stand behind them, bend them over forwards, hit

abdominal thrusts above belly button in and up

can use corners and edges to self administer; trying to force diaphragm to use lung air to push object out

if the person is too large to put your arms around or is pregnant, give chest thrusts

### Breathing Emergencies

rescue breaths extremely important

need to pump oxygen into the lungs with rescue breaths while pumping the blood around with chest compressions

### cardiac arrest

heart stops beating

S/S:
- sudden Unresponsiveness , not breathing

call 911, start CPR

### heart attack

blood flow to the heart is blocked, which damages it

may be responsive or breathing

S/S: chest pain that radiates to one or both arms or even the neck and jaw; can also present as stomach pain and indigestion; out of place shortness of breath

symptoms of women are not the same as men

getting to care early can make a life or death difference

do not play around with heart attacks, do not hesitate to call 911

until the ambulance arrives, keep the person calm and help them rest

if they can swallow and follow commands, give 325 mg of (only) asprin

## CPR

### Steps

Check scene for safety

Check person for responsiveness

If Unresponsive and not breathing, tell someone by name to call 911 and get AED

Start CPR: 1 cycle = 30 chest compressions and 2 rescue breaths

### Chest Compressions

want person on their back and on a firm flat surface

place one hand in center of chest, stack other hand on top, finger tips up

stack shoulders, elbows, wrists and lock elbows

compression depth:
- adults: > 2 in
- children: ~ 2 in

Rate: 100 - 120

compressions should be smoothe, regular and straight up and down

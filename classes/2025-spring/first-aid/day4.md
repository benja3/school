# Day 4

### statistics

4/5 cardiac arrests happen outside of hospitals

CPR prevents brain and tissue damage while professionals come; does not sustain life indefinitely

Brain damage can start in 4-6 minutes after heart stops and becomes irreversible at 8-10 minute mark

good outcomes are when CPR is started 1-2 minutes after the cardiac arrest

### AED: Automatic External Defibrillator

Device that analyzes the heart for a shockable rhythm

Delivers an elecrtric shock to restore normal heart rhythm and function

found in high traffic areas
- entrances
- elevators
- stairways
- places where they might need to be used (pools, gyms)

there is a website with all AEDs in Clemson

### Steps to Use AED

use as soon as it becomes available

designed to be able to easily used

1. turn it on
2. expose persons bare chest (take off all clothes)
3. place pads on upper right and lower left sides of chest
4. plug them in and do not touch the patient; say clear loudly
5. deliver a shock

### CPR and Rescue Breath Review

CPR:
- 1 CPR cycle = 30 compressions + 2 breaths
- Patient should be on their back on a firm flat surface
- place hands between the centers of the pecs
- keep arms straight with elbows straight
- use heel of hand and keep finger tips up

Chest Compressions:
- at least two inches for adults; just push as hard as you can for an adult
- rate 100 - 120 compressions per minute; 15 - 18 seconds for 30

Rescue Breaths:
- tilt head all the way back to open airway
- breaths should last about 1 second
- look for chest rising

Steps:
1. check scene safety
2. check for responsiveness and breathing
3. tell a bystander to call 911 and get AED
4. Perform CPR cycles until EMS arrives

### CPR What Ifs?

If first breath fails, retilt the head and try again

If second breath fails, immediately resume compressions. On next cycle, check for an object blocking airway. If you can see an object, get it out.

If you can't give breaths through the persons mouth, give through the nose or stoma. Cover the mouth, seal your mouth over the nose and perform breaths. Stoma: hole in the throat used for breathing due to certain medical conditions.

If person vomits during CPR or has other fluid in mouth, put them in the recovery position, wipe away vomit and resume CPR.

### AED Do's and Don'ts

Pediatric pads are only for children under age 8 and under 55 lbs. When in doubt, use the adult pads.

Don't shave the persons chest unless the pads don't stick at all

Can use it on someone with implanted device

It is safe to use the AED in rain or snow or if the person is on a metal surface

If person has piercings, place the pads around them
















### Cardiac Chain of Survival

early recognition -> early call 911 for extra resources -> early CPR -> early AED -> early advanced life support

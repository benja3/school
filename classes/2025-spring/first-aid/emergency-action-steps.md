## Emergency Action Steps

### Check

It is important to know if it is safe for you to help

Do not enter unsafe scenarios:
- water emergencies
- fires

Can you make the scene safe?
- traffic accidents
- heat illness: get them to a cooler space
- small fire (put it out)

### Call

call immediately for unresponsive people or other life threatening conditions





### Care

get consent
- implied if person is unconscious

conduct SAM interview

perform a focused check of what the issue is
- control the scene and provide privacy if possible

make sure your hands are clean, warm and gloved



## Form Initial Impression

How sick is the person?

Body language (tripoding, facial expression, skin color change)

Calling for help

breathing difficulties

### head and spine injury

head injuries can lead to spinal injuries

blows to the head

falling from heights and landing on certain parts

whiplash

if head and spine injury, jump to call step

leave in position found unless airway is compromised

airway is a priority over all else

## SAM Check

### Signs / Symptoms

What happened? What hurts?

Anything you observe in initial impression

### Allergies

Some treatments could be deadly if they are allergic too them

Don't make the situation worse

Check for epipen on the person if there are symptoms of a reaction

### Medications / Medical Conditions

Never give someone your own medicine or over the counter drugs, leave this to EMS

## Focused Check

assess the injury

look, listen and feel

look for deformity, open injuries, tenderness, swelling

when touching an injury, use a balance of pressure such that it does not cause more pain, but it is also not too light

abnormal sounds

unable/unwilling to move a body part

### vital signs



### AVPU Scale

Awake
- oriented if can tell you who they are, where they are, what time of day it is, and what happened before the event

Voice (react to vocal stimulus but are not fully awake)

Pain (pinch a pressure point and look for a response)

Unresponsive

### Heart Rate

beats per minute

assess at the wrist using middle or index finger

find radial pulse, count beats in 15 seconds and multiply by 4

normal: 60-100 beats per minute

### Respiratory Rate

how many breaths per minute

breathing can be controlled and interrupted by the person, so don't tell them you are watching their breathing

look for rise and fall of chest or stomach, count for 30 seconds and multiply by 2

normal: 12-20 deep and unlabored breaths per minute

### Skin

Shows how well the circulatory system is working

skin inside the lower lip should always be pink; if its not, there is not enough oxygenated blood

check if temperature is significantly different than 98.6

Skin should be dry, check if people are sweating when they shouldn't be

abnormal: pale, cool and clammy
- going into shock, having a heart attack, etc.

16 * 4 = 64

If you cannot feel a pulse in the wrist, thats bad

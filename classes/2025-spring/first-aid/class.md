What stops people from responding when an emergency happens?
- panic
- not trusting skills and knowledge
- not wanting to be held responsible for mistakes
- bystander effect
- fear of hurting someone or ourselves

there are good samaritan laws that prevent responders from civil liability if they act in good faith within scope of training

cannot accept compensation from helping someone and be protected

First responders like EMTs, Firefighters, doctors, etc. have a Duty to Act

To get proper consent, introduce yourself, state your training and ask if they want help

Unresponsive people imply consent, same with unattended children

ask questions early because if the person becomes Unresponsive, you could get information they can't

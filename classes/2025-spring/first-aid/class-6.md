# Class 6: Sudden Illness

## Shock

life threatening condition that cannot be managed by first aid alone

physiologically, the circulatory system fails to deliver oxygen rich blood to the vital organs and tissues

practically: it is a fluid problem, an oxygen problem or a pump problem

stress injuries present similarly to shock, but vital signs will eventually return to normal

### Causes

Severe bleeding (could also be internal)

Anaphylaxis

heart or spine problems

severe infection

dehydration

### Vital Signs

heart rate: rapid, weak and potentially irregular

breathing: rapid, shallow  

skin: pale, cool and clammy  

mental state: anxious, restless, confused

changes to level of responsiveness

### Treatment

Call 911

raise legs above heart

Treat the cause of shock according to your level of training

Keep the person calm and comfortable

Do not give them anything by mouth
- they could aspirate it or it could interfere with the EMS planned treatment

Regulate body temperature

## Diabetes / Blood Sugar Emergencies

Diabetes is a chronic condition where the body cannot process Glucose

Emergencies happen when blood sugar gets too low or too high

### Too low: Hypoglycemia

### Too high: Hyperglycemia

If awake, SAM interview:
- Follow up questions

Ask them if they can check their sugar

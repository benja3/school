## Level of Responsiveness (LOR)

### AVPU Scale

Unresponsive: not awake and does not respond to stimulus

Pain: not awake but respond to painful stimulus

Voice: not awake but responds to voice

Awake: ask questions on person, place, time and events
- based on answers, people can be A to O x 0-4 based on how many question they answer
- A to 0 x <= 2 is dangerous
- if someone has dementia or mental illness, ask the caregiver what is normal

Altered mental state has a lot of nuance depending on the person and their condition

## ABC's

All of these are life threats; if any interrupted, call EMS

CPR: 30 chest compressions, 2 rescue breaths

### Airway

something is in the throat that prevents them from breathing

abdominal thrusts AKA Heimlich

do abdominal thrusts until the airway is clear or the person is Unresponsive

if Unresponsive and not breathing: CPR

### Breathing

look for abnormal breathing or absence of breathing

### Circulation

See blood? stop the bleeding

do not bother to take pulse; if someone is in cardiac arrest, immediately start CPR

## Ages

Infant: up to 1 year

Child: 1 year to puberty

Adult: has breast development and underarm hair

Infants are at higher risk for choking because
- can't chew and swallow well
- they put everything in their mouth
- don't have teeth
- small airways

### Infant Choking

5 back blows + 5 chest thrusts

for back blows and chest thrusts, head below chest so gravity will pull the object out into the mouth

signs: face color change, can't make sound

do not be afraid to hit hard

after blows and thrusts, get the infant seen in case the maneuvers caused internal damage

## Hypothermia

definition: body is losing heat faster than it can replace it; core temp < 95

best thing to do is notice early symptoms and take action then

signs: shivering, pale/blue skin color

shivering is good because its a sign the body is trying to rewarm itself

when shivering stops, it is a medical emergency

you start losing fine motor control when you get cold because the body pools blood in the vital organs

the umbles: cannot use extremities well

life threatening situation:
- altered mental state
- decreased or irregular heart rate

### prevention

prevention is better than treatment

avoid falling in water; dress for immersion whether you intend to or not if there is a chance you could fall in

have necessary gear for worst case scenario

body needs calories to keep warm; stay well fed

lose temperature by:
- evaporation: sweating
- radiation: not having enough layers
- convection: wind
- conduction: surfaces, immersion

### Treatment

Change your environment; get somewhere warm

Put on more layers

drink warm sugary drinks

when camping:
- lay tarp on ground
- use pad to insulate from ground
- put sleeping back on top
- take off wet clothes
- get in
- wrap tarp around sleeping bag

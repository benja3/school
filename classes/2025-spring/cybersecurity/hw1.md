## Overview

Attacking authentication capability of server API using length extension attack of MD5 hash

Generating MD5 Hash collisions

Using a Docker container

### Hash Collisions





## Research

MAC: Message Authentication Code: prevents against spoofing

HMACs approximate psuedorandom functions and hash functions do not

hashes subject to length extension attack

length extension attack: if the has of an n-block message is known, can find the hash of longer messages by applying the compression function for each extra block

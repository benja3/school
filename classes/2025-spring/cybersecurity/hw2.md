# Homework 2

## Overview

Taking advantage of padding oracles to exploit Vulnerabilities

Part 1: decrypt a message without knowing the key

Part 2: forge a digital signature



## Research

### Padding Oracle Attack

Vulnerability exists if a server responds saying that padding is invalid. This allows an attacker to keep changing the padding until it gets accepted.

### Video

Server takes messages of arbitrary length, and wants to enforce Confidentiality and integrity

all CBC messages have padding

since MAC is based on plain text, must decrypt before MAC checked (using MAC then Encrypt)

Server will first check the padding of the encrypted message to check for correctness
- will return padding error if padding bad
- will return MAC error if the padding is correct but the MAC fails

example: mallory intercepts 12 byte message and its MAC and has access to server described above
- can byte by byte decrypt the whole message

important note: specific bytes of the ciphertext and decryption function output get XORed with each other

mallory encrypts byte by 1:
- server decrypts ciphertext

change 1 byte of cipher text to every possible value. Only one will produce a MAC error and not a padding error.

### RSA Forgery

If a message is created such that regular exponentiation is used instead of modular, it is easy to reverse.

RSA signature validation is the same process as RSA encryption

To construct a forged signature that the lazy validation implementation would validate, find x where x^3 < n

Construct an integer whos most significant bytes have the correct format, and set the last 201 bytes to 0

magic code is 19 bytes  

### Base64 Strings

NEVER MAKE ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT HOW SOMETHING WORKS

Base64 strings are generated by splitting a binary blob into 6 bit block. Since in normal strings, characters are 8 bits, this disrupts the block alignment and can mask patterns in the original data.

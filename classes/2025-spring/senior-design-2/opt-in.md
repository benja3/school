Question 1: Why are you opting for this mode of senior design? (1-3 sentences answer should suffice.)

I have done internships at national labs, but would like an industry experience before I graduate. I would like the experience of working with an industry mentor and a taste of industry culture. Overall, I am looking for the experience of working on an industry team based engineering project to decide if I want to work in industry or national lab after I graduate.

Question 2: What project(s) are you interested in? If industry sponsored project(s), please mention the company name as well. If you are interested in a specific project only, please ignore Priority 2, Priority 3 and so on. If your project lies in category THREE, answering Zen garden will be good enough.

1. GE (Computer Vision Tool)
2. Aeronix (Train Braking Software Team)
3. Michelin (Machine Vision)

Question 3: Briefly explain what skills or background make you a compelling candidate for the top three projects prioritized in Q2.

I have done two internships at Los Alamos National Lab in Supercomputer software engineering and system administration, where I designed and implemented software tools for system administrators. These experiences taught me many hard and soft skills that make me a strong member of any engineering team. Also, I have done REU with Dr. Calhoun, where I wrote and published a full paper on fault toleranace in floating point arithmetic at the SC23 technical conference and presented it in a workshop. This gave me good R&D and project management experience. Lastly, I have competed in the prestigious Student Cluster Competition several times, which was a great team building exercise and trained me to work well under pressure. I believe having these experiences as an undergrad make me a premium selection for any software related role on these projects.

Question 4: Are you in touch with a group/team of students interested in the same project?

No

Question 5: Are you EE or CpE major?

CpE

Question 6: Do you have a full-time or part-time job, internship, coop or similar commitments that keep you off-campus for extended periods of time?

No

Question 7: Any other atypical circumstances?

No

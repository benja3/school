# Chapter 1: Introduction 

## Programming Language 

### Definition 1

A programming language is a notational system insftended to facilitate human machine interaction

Created to make machines more easily programmable by humans

In the past, programs were written in hex using pluggable switches; This was not practical, took forever, and limited computer capabilities 

Notations must be human and machine readable 

Langauges created to make using the computer easier 


### Definition 2

from a linguistics view point, a programming language has a syntax, and the elements of the language have semantics 

syntax just involves parsing 

semantics invovles the meaning of the different parts of the language
- what does an operation or declaration mean to the human and the computer 

Semantics can be up to interpretation, which can cause issues with computers and humans 

## Program

A program is comething that is produced by a programming language 

The programming language is abstract, and the program is the entity created using the language  

A language is a set of abstract tools and components 

## Formal Approaches 

A formal langauge is based on a formal grammar, calling this specific grammar "G" 

Programming languages designed to be flexible 

Can create programs from sentences or strings produced by G
- sentences consist of strings 

A programming languages is the set of all possible strings in G 

AI is now being used to parse instead of formal grammars 

If a string cannot be produced by G, it is not in the language 

## Software and Moores Law

Software evolves with computers

Babbage: software in the form of gears for mechancial computers

## Point of Departure

Nature of languages was once very similar to the nature of the hardware of the machine 

Lots of old progamming language features were included to perform certain low level hardware operations efficiently 

These days there are lots of different architectures and most programmers do not care about the differences, and want to write code that will run universally 

languages should be more broad 

Spaghetti code: originally describes code with tons of jumps that goes all over the plce 

## Paradigms 

### Procedural 

C, Fortran 

Tell the computer what to do step by step 

Involves variables, and operations 

### Functional 

call functions on data types to modify them 

does not have variables

Why use functional? Can make certain complex programs simpler to implement and understand. Call functions to perform the lower level operations instead of performing them yourself 

Functional notation is descriptive enough to make code self documenting 

### Declarative 

Declare things instead of telling the computer what to do

Based on the connections from the declarations, the computer will solve the problem 

### Object Oriented 

allows for creation of user level types that can be manipulated 

Types like structs that contain unique descriptive data 

Also can declare methods that operate on types 

Inheritance: allows for effective code reuse

promotes good programming practices 

### Rule based

applies rules to a declared problems to solve it

### Event Driven

Define how to handle different events that will occur in the environment the program is operating in 

Events and handlers 

Used in deadline based real time systems

Also used in user interfaces 

Similar to interrupt handlers but software implemented 

A callback is the same thing as a handler 

### Parallel / Concurrent 

Solve problems with multiple processes running on multiple processors 

## Syntax 

metalanguage: language that describes the language 

Syntax defines allowable arangements of symbols and the structure of the language 

## Code Reading 

Most professional programmers spend their time modifying existing code, which requires great code reading skills 

Learning to write high quality code comes from reading high quality code 

Look up open source programs and read the code for practice
